# streaming-movie-app
I made this project for testing, it's for movie streaming and movie listing


it need some dependences such as:


    "@react-navigation/material-bottom-tabs": "^6.2.10",
    "@react-navigation/native": "^6.1.1",
    "@rneui/themed": "^4.0.0-rc.7",
    "expo": "~47.0.9",
    "expo-status-bar": "~1.4.2",
    "react": "18.1.0",
    "react-native": "0.70.5",
    "react-native-anchor-carousel": "^4.0.1",
    "react-native-safe-area-context": "^4.4.1",
    "react-native-screens": "~3.18.0",
    "react-native-vector-icons": "^9.2.0"
    
    
    I faced a problem making the Video component up and running in the theatre screen, I hope you would fix that.
to do list:
Splash screen
Rate inside a star in the List Comp
adding the rest of the info of the movies inside the Card comp under title
theatre video player and also list of eps
changing the Font style
back to the top btn in the List comp
